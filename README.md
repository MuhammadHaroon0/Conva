A Realtime chat application based on Socket.io and MERN stack.
![WELCOME](https://github.com/muhammadharoon9802/Conva/assets/110344816/94ca1bbd-3221-466c-b297-da9a67cd3c53)

# It has a large number of features such as :

-Realtime conversation.
-Adding friends based on their emails.
-Registration and Sign in of Users based on their emails.
-Emoji picker for sending emojis in messages.
-Email functionality with complete authentication.
-Profile Picture upload and display on UI.
-Searching specific user chats based on their names.

The API of this application is perfectly secured, authenticated, and finely shaped according to MVC architecture. Chats and users data has been stored in Mongo DB. No compromises have been made on the Authentication and Security of Signed Up users. Update password, Forgot Password, Welcome Email, Password Reset Email, Route protection, Pre and Post data-save middlewares, Dealing with static files, Image editing and file uploading, and concepts of Sockets events have been used.

I've not focused too much on styling as main focus was on Bidirectional and low-latency communication between client and server but the app is fully responsive for all types of screens that exist nowadays. Whether it is a Desktop, Laptop, or Mobile Phone (portrait and landscape) the website is perfectly styled with media queries and content shifting. The front end is designed with Tailwind CSS, Custom CSS, and Bootstrap.

Performance is a critical aspect of realtime chat application development, as it directly impacts user experience. The application is fast and used the most popular javascript frontend library React. API store has been created with the State management library Zustand which consumes less boilerplate and is efficient.

Many other features can be added based on the requirements of users. There is always room for improvement!
